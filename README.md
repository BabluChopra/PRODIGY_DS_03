Decision Tree Classifier for Predicting Customer Purchases
This repository contains code for building a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. The classifier is trained on the Bank Marketing dataset obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Dataset Description
The Bank Marketing dataset contains information about marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The dataset includes demographic variables such as age, job, marital status, education, and behavioral variables such as previous marketing campaign outcomes, contact methods, and customer balances.

Installation
